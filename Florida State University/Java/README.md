# The Java Folder 
<em> By Kalecia McNeal</em>
Welcome to the Java Folder! Java is one of the most important back-end languages responsible for programming everything from mobile apps to big data applications. Java serves as a business layer for helping to connect front-end languages like HTML to back end databases such as MySQL. 

In this folder, there are two specific classes that focus on Java. Below are the summaries, skills, and tools used for each class. For more information about the assignments then you can click the links below to view the class folder README.

# List of Classes: 
## <em>COP 2258: Oriented-Object Programming With Java</em>
### Summary: 
The ability to solve problems creatively using computational methods has become important to professionals in many disciplines. This interdisciplinary course is designed for students who are not necessarily intent on becoming computer programmers but are interested in understanding the principles that govern Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and software development in order to assist with problem-solving in their own disciplines.

The course addresses various topics including algorithm-building principles, problem-solving strategies, how to analyze problems to identify requirements, and how to design an object-oriented solution.  Students design, write and debug computer programs. <br>

### Skills Acquired:  
- Analyzed a problem by specifying the requirements, design an object-oriented solution, and produce a testing plan to validate the solution.

- Designed and implemented basic programming solutions including statements, control structures, methods, and objects.

- Illustrated program readability/understanding including program style/formatting and self-documenting code.

- Demonstrated the ability to program using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

- Defined and explained object-oriented programming concepts.

### Tools Used During Class: 
- ZyBooks (learning)
- Amazon AWS (IDE)
- Visual Studio Code (programming practice)
- Google Chrome (OS)

## <em>LIS 4368: Advanced Web Development</em>
### Summary: 
This course provides a foundation in developing web applications with an emphasis on server-side
concepts, tools and methods. Topics include basic web application programming, advanced object-
oriented (OOP) and web application development.

Students enrolled in this course will develop basic programming skills in a modern web development
environment, understand web application development principles and be able to find and use web
application development resources on the Internet.


### Skills Acquired:  
- Demonstrated the ability to program and deploy client/server-side scripts

- Developed a dynamic web application using a mix of front-end and back-end web technologies

- Employed OOP techniques, as well as business logic using a strongly typed language

- Demonstrated web application to data source connectivity

- Created client and server-side data validation

### Tools Used During Class: 
- Visual Studio Code (coding)
- Bitbucket (Remote Repository)
- Google Chrome (OS)
