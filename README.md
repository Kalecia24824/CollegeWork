# Welcome to College Work
<em>By Kalecia McNeal</em>

Here you can find all of my projects I have completed so far in college! 

In each folder, there will be sub-folders based on the subject or course material in the main directory. Here are the folders:   

## Florida State University: 
This folder contains all of my college work from the time I started to learn how to code to when I finished my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology. Each folder has a specific language which contains each class the language was a focus of along with its own READMEs and folders containing the work I did.
