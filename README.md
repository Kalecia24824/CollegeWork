# Welcome to My Portfolio 
<em>By Kalecia McNeal</em>

Here you can find all of my projects I have completed so far in college and in my free time! 

In each folder, there will be sub-folders based on the subject or course material in the main directory. Here are the folders:   

## Florida State University: 
This folder will contain all of my beginner work from University. Each subfolder will be a language consisting of classwork and assignments.

## Personal:
This folder will be similar to the first folders with the sub-folders as languages but except those will contain monthly projects.
