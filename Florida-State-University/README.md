# Welcome to the Florida State University folder 
<em>By Kalecia McNeal</em>

Here you can find all of my projects I have completed so far in college at Florida State University. Each folder will consist of a language I learned with the class associated as the sub-folders.


## List of Folders by Language: 
These are the list of folders in the Florida State University folder. 

### HTML & CSS:
These classes were focused on front-end languages such as HyperText Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets. Some of these classes will consist of a README since the website or projects are no longer active. 

- Link to HTML README: [HTML README](HTML/README.md "My HTML README file")

- Link to CSS README: [CSS README](CSS/README.md "My CSS README file")

### JavaScript: 
As the interactive front-end and back-end language, JavaScript serves a double edge sword for programmers. In this case, some of the classes will be the same but there will be specific assignment

- Link to JavaScript README: [JS README](JS/README.md "My JavaScript README file")

### Java: 
As the first back-end language, Java is an object-oriented programming language designed to assist with servers and APIs. Some of these classes will have simple Java programs while others will have more complex programs combined with front-end languages.

### MySQL: 
As the final and second back-end language in this directory, MySQL stands for My Structured Query Language. As a relational database language, it is responsible for storing, reading, manipulating and editing data.
