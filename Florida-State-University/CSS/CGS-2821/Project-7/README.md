# Project 7 README 
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

Welcome to the Project 7 README! Here you find out what I did for the assignment by looking through the objective, tools, requirements and final thought process. At the end, there will be an image added to the bottom for the final result!

## Objective: 

### Tools: 
- Visual Studio Code (coding)
- Google Chrome (final viewing)
- CyberDuck (file uploading)

### Requirements: 
- A consistent page layout applied to all pages on the website. Site does not move or nudge between pages.

- The entire site is placed inside a container DIV which is centered on the page

- The CSS contains a custom ID called container with the correct container properties covered in the lesson
- A unique header section with a banner image and navigation menu nested within the header tag

- A unique navigation section with customized links using descendant selectors (nav a:link, nav a:hover, nav a:visited) so that navigation menu links appear differently than other hyperlinks in the main content area of the site

- A unique footer section at the bottom of each page

- Proper spacing between elements and sections, achieved by adjusting margins and padding

- The design is free of legibility issues, as color and font size are used effectively in all areas

- Properly indented and validated code (HTML and CSS)

### Final Thought Process: 
In the picture below, I was creating navigation elements which was not easy. I did change the text from black to white (should have stuck with black) Besides the rudimentary blocks of headers and footer, I was proud of the progress I made.
