# Project 6 README 
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

Welcome to the Project 6 README! Here you find out what I did for the assignment by looking through the objective, tools, requirements and final thought process. At the end, there will be an image added to the bottom for the final result!

## Objective: 

### Tools:
- Visual Studio Code (coding)
- Google Chrome (final viewing)
- CyberDuck (file uploading)

### Requirements: 
- A pleasing and appropriate color palette, preferably one created for the last assignment, is well-implemented

- The link tag is used to link an external style sheet called style.css to all HTML pages.

- Body styles (font-family, font-size, line-height, background-color) comply with color palette and are different from the example CSS provided.

- Link styles for each state (a:link, a:visited, a:hover) comply with the color palette and easily identify clickable links on the page

- Other styles (paragraphs, headings, lists, tables, etc.) comply with the color palette and create a design unique to the content that is different from the example CSS provided

- Typography styles (fonts, font colors, font sizes, and line spacing) fit the site topic and are legible in all areas

- Color is used effectively in all areas where it has been applied

- Properly indented and validated code (HTML and CSS)

### Final Thought Process: 
This is the first color version of the website prototype I made. As you can see, there are some issues that needed some work. Such as the color of the text and spacing of the items. Overall, I had fun sticking to the final color scheme from Project 5.
