# Project 5 README 
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

Welcome to the Project 5 README! Here you find out what I did for the assignment by looking through the objective, tools, requirements and final thought process. At the end, there will be an image added to the bottom for the final result!

## Objective: 

### Tools: 
- Google Chrome 
- Adobe Color Picker (color scheme)

### Requirements: 
- Three separate color palettes that relate to your website's topic of choice

- Each color palette must consist of four colors

- Each color palette should be given a creative name

- Each color palette should include a color sample and the required color code

- Each color palette should include a description and explanation of why the colors were chosen

- One color palette should be comprised of RGB color codes

- One color palette should be comprised of HSL color codes

- One color palette should be comprised of Hexadecimal color codes

- One palette should include a set of complementary colors

- One palette should be a monochrome color palette

### Final Thought Process: 
These were the possible color schemes I was considering for the website. After making at least 3 or more, I came to the AI palette because the colors reminded me of technology.
