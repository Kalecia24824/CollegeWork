# Project Final README 
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

Welcome to the Project 5 README! Here you find out what I did for the assignment by looking through the objective, tools, requirements and final thought process. At the end, there will be an image added to the bottom for the final result!

## Objective: 

### Tools: 
- Visual Studio Code (coding)
- Google Chrome (viewing)
- CyberDuck (file uploading)

### Final Thought Process: 
This is the final version of my website before I made an online version using Wix. As you can see, I did some major improvements by fixing the navigation, spacing elements and adding a references box. 

### Picture of the Final Design:
