# Project 8 README 
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

Welcome to the Project 8 README! Here you find out what I did for the assignment by looking through the objective, tools, requirements and final thought process. At the end, there will be an image added to the bottom for the final result!

## Objective: 

### Tools: 
- Visual Studio Code (coding)
- Google Chrome (final viewing)
- CyberDuck (file uploading)

### Requirements: 
- A working navigation menu styled as tabs or buttons, using the nav tag, which is consistent in position and styling across all pages

- A navigation menu implemented using a styled unordered list .

- The navigation menu button for the current page is styled separately to clearly indicate it is the selected page.

- The navigation menu button for the current page does not change appearance when it is hovered over.

- The navigation menu is styled appropriately with fonts and colors that match the existing site theme.

- A container div divided into two section tags, one with class="main" and one with id="sidebar"

- A sidebar with unique content on all pages of the site, which is consistent in position and styling across all pages

- Proper spacing between elements and sections, achieved by adjusting margins and padding

- Properly indented and validated code (HTML and CSS)

### Final Thought Process: 
And this is the final hard coding version of my website. The website looks like a blog which is something I was going for. However, I should have changed the big background and spacing of the bannera and the container of the website.
