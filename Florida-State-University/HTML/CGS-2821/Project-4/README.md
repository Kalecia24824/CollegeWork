# Project 4 README 
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

Welcome to the Project 4 README! Here you find out what I did for the assignment by looking through the objective, tools, requirements and final thought process. At the end, there will be an image added to the bottom for the final result!

## Objective: 

### Tools: 
- CyberDuck
- Visual Studio Code 
- Google Chrome (viewing)
- Pixabay (images)

### Requirements: 
- Working link to project4 folder on server 

- Index.html and two other HTML files

- At least three images, one large banner image, and a smaller image

- One image should be clearly edited in some way

- The proper HTML template structure on all three pages

- Alt text for all image tags

- Site is logically divided into three pages using content from previous assignment

- Each page's section includes the descriptive h2 tag

- A working navigation menu using the nav tag

- A footer section on each page with the copyright symbol, name, and date

- Consistent header, nav, and footer across all pages

- One section on a page should include an embedded video

- References are on last page of the site, converted into clickable hyperlinks

- Reference hyperlinks open in a new tab

- Properly indented and validated code

### Final Thought Process: 
Here I was learning about sematic HTML with the nav, header, and footer elements. I chose these pictures for the website below because the subject is AI and how it can help. I also used some resources to support the claims.
