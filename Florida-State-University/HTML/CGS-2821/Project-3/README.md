Welcome to the Project 3 README! Here you find out what I did for the assignment by looking through the objective, tools, requirements and final thought process. At the end, there will be an image added to the bottom for the final result!

## Objective:

### Final Thought Process: 
This assignment uses HTML which was helpful since I just a class that focuses on the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS (JavaScript). This was also where I decided what my website would be which is based on AI.
