# Project 2 README 
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

Welcome to the Project 2 README! Here you find out what I did for the assignment by looking through the objective, tools, requirements and final thought process. At the end, there will be an image added to the bottom for the final result!

## Objective: 

### Tools: 
- CyberDuck
- Visual Studio Code 
- Google Chrome (viewing)

### Requirements: 
- A working link to YOUR project2 folder on the class server.

- Your site should include the index.html file inside your project2 folder

- Your site should include the style.css file inside your project2 folder

- Your site should include the banner.jpg image inside your project2 folder

- index.html should be edited to include your full name

- style.css should be edited to change the background color

### Final Thought Process:
I was nervous when I first entered the class because I just switched from special education to information technology. At first, I had a hard time trying to learn how to code. But by the end of this assignment I did very well. Notice the banner is missing because I forgot to add the image into the directory (rookie mistake!)
