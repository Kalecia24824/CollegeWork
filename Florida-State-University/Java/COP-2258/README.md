# The COP 2258 folder: Problem Solving with Object-Oriented Programming

Welcome to the COP 2258 folder where you will find my work in my Problem Solving with Object-Oriented Programming!

To learn more about the class, you can read the summary, assignments, tools and skills below: 

### Summary: 
The ability to solve problems creatively using computational methods has become important to professionals in many disciplines. This interdisciplinary course is designed for students who are not necessarily intent on becoming computer programmers but are interested in understanding the principles that govern Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and software development in order to assist with problem-solving in their own disciplines.

The course addresses various topics including algorithm-building principles, problem-solving strategies, how to analyze problems to identify requirements, and how to design an object-oriented solution.  Students design, write and debug computer programs. 


### Skills Acquired:  
1. Analyzed a problem by specifying the requirements, design an object-oriented solution, and produce a testing plan to validate the solution

2. Illustrated program readability/understanding including program style/formatting and self-documenting code

3. Designed and implement basic programming solutions including statements, control structures, methods, and objects

4. Analyzed a problem by specifying the requirements, design an object-oriented solution, and produce a testing plan to validate the solution

5. Demonstrate the ability to program using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

### Tools Used During Class: 
- VSC: Visual Studio Code 
- Mac/Windows PC 
- ZyBooks
- Amazon AWS Cloud9
