# The Java Folder 
<em> By Kalecia McNeal</em>
Welcome to the Java Folder! Java is one of the most important back-end languages responsible for programming everything from mobile apps to big data applications. Java serves as a business layer for helping to connect front-end languages like HTML to back end databases such as MySQL. 

In this folder, there are two specific classes that focus on Java. Below are the summaries, skills, and tools used for each class. For more information about the assignments then you can click the links below to view the class folder README.
