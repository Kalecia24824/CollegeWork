# Web Design Folder 
<em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

Welcome to the Web Design folder! 

Here in this folder, I will have projects based on my own ideas or inspiration from other designers from the web. The process starts with a simple UX/UI Tool such as Figma for brainstorming, wireframing and designing a prototype. Then the prototype is developed through the use of code with languages like HTML. Finally, the project is created and displayed on a website with hosting from Wix or WordPress. 

## List of Projects: 
Each project will contain a README detailing the process, some development files and a design image. 



## Closing Note
With that I hope you enjoy reading each README and going through each mini project!
