# Welcome to the Personal Projects folder 
<em>By Kalecia McNeal</em>

Here in this folder, you will find all of my personal projects I make in my personal time. The sub-folders will have their own READMEs and project files. 

## List of Folders: 
These are the list of folders in the Personal Projects folder. 

## Web Design: 
In this folder, it will contain README with the list of projects in the Figma directory. Each sub-folder will have a README listing my process, brainstorming and the final design file.  

### Link to Web Design README.md: 
[Web Design README.md](/Personal-Projects/Web-Design/README.md "My Web Design README.md")

## Web Development: 
This folder is very similar to the Web Design folder except, it will contain different project files based on level of difficulty.
