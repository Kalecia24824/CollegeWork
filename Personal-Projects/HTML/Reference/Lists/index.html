        <h1>Types of Lists</h1>
        <em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>
        <p>Lists are very important because they organize information into one place. There are other elements and content that can organize information. But for now, let's view the different types which are unordered, ordered and description. </p> <br> 

        <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
        <p>unordered lists are lists that are not numbered. These lists will have a default of a black circle unless you use CSS to change the style of the element. But for now, here is an example of an <u>unordered</u> list:</p>

        <h3>Grocery List</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Bread</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As you can see this list has three items someone needs for groceries</p> <br> 

        <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
        <p>Up next is ordered lists. These lists are important because they have an order. Ordered lists can also be used to <strong>categorize</strong> items. An example of this can be see below:</p>

        <h3>Colors of the Rainbow:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Red</li>
            <li>Orange</li>
            <li>Yellow</li>
            <li>Green</li>
            <li>Blue</li>
            <li>Indigo</li>
            <li>Violet</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These colors are in order based on number and <em>hierarchy</em>. Lists like these are crucial when putting items together in order.</p> <br>

        <h2>Description Lists</h2>
        <p>Lastly, but not least, we have description lists which are used to add descriptions or summaries to list items. Like this:</p>

        <h3>Fruits</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Apples</dt>
            <dd>A shiny red fruit</dd>
            <dt>Strawberries</dt>
            <dd>A small red berry with seeds on the outside</dd>
            <dt>Banana</dt>
            <dd>A curved yellow fruit</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>As you can see, the description list contains the (dl) tag which is the list itself, (dt) the term and (dd) which is the description describing each item</p> <br>  

        <p>Finally, you learned about all three types of lists from unordered to description lists. I hope this guide helps you in deciding which list you need for the job!</p>
