        <h1>Headings and Paragraphs</h1>
        <p>by Kalecia McNeal</p>
        <p>Today, we will show you how paragraphs and headings are made. Like the sentence above, you can add sentences to HTML by using the (p) element. The p stands for paragraph.</p>
        
        <p>To make a heading, you can use the letter h followed by a number from 1 to 6. The only difference is h1 is the biggest with h6 the smallest.</p>

        <p>Like this: 
            <h1>First Heading</h1> <br>
            <h2>Second Heading</h2> <br>
            <h3>Third Heading</h3> <br>
        </p>
