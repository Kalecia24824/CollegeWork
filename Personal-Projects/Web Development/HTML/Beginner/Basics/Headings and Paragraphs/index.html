        <p>Today, we will show you how paragraphs and headings are made. Like the sentence above, you can add sentences to HTML by using the (p) element. The p stands for paragraph.</p>
        
        <p>To make a heading, you can use the letter h followed by a number from 1 to 6. The only difference is h1 is the biggest with h6 the smallest.</p>
