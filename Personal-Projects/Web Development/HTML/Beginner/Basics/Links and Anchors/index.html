        <h1>Links</h1>
        <p>Today, we will learn about links. Links are important because they can help connect the user to different info. Before we view some examples, you need to understand how they work <br> <br>
        
        A link consist of three things: the a tags, href and target attributes. The a tags stand for anchor, the href is the hyperlink url and the target attribute determines where the document will be opened at. 
        </p> <br> <br> 

        <p>Now, there various types of links but we will present at least three examples: <br> 
        </p>

        <h2>Example One: Regular</h2>
        <p>For the first example, I will present a regular link to Pixabay where I get all of the images for my projects. <a href="https://pixabay.com/" target="_self">(Click here for Pixabay)</a> <br> <br>
        
        As you can see, the link above has the url for the href attribute and the target which is set to open in the same tab once you click on it. 
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Example Two: Image Link</h2>
        <p>If you looked back in the image project then you saw an example with the picture of an apple. Well, this time we will do one that links to another website about stars. <br> <br> 
        
        If you click on the star image below, it will take you to a page by NASA that talks about stars in a new page: <br> 
        <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/universe/stars/" target="_blank">
            <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/11/29/04/32/star-5786426_640.png" alt="" height="100" width="120"></a>
        </p> <br> 

        <h2>Example Three: Buttons as Links</h2>
        <p>For our last and final example, I will show you how buttons can be used to link to other web pages as well. To do this, you will need to use a little bit of JavaScript using the onclick function. <br> <br> 

        Here is an example using the onclick. Go ahead and click on the button to see what happens: <br> <br>

        <button onclick="document.location='https://cupcakeipsum.com/'">Surprise Me!</button>
        </p>

        <p>And that is it for links! I hoped you enjoyed reading about links as much as I do. </p>
