        <h1>About Images</h1>
        <em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

        <p>Today, we will learn about and how to use images in HTML. Now there are various of ways to do it but we will take a look at three main ways. </p> <br> 

        <h2>The Regular Way</h2>
        <p>Before revealing the first image, we need to learn how the img element works. The image tag or img is used to embed images in a web page. These tags allow the user to visualize content online. <br> <br>

        Now, the img tag has two attributes: src which specific the path and alt which provides alternative text for accessibility. Now, that you understand the terms here is what the syntax of the img element would look like: (img src="url" alt="text") <br> <br>

        Here is the first image based on our results: <br>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSMjQRyjAa4aH7uZgqNVyJ5Orf5aE7vP4rMDAuVd9esuKH1PwfEp1fCGTXvcCr2SCbCSDk&usqp=CAU" alt="a bowl of cherries"> <br> <br>

        Notice how the img does not have a closing tag. That is because it is a closed tag which means the element does not need a closing.
        </p> <br> <br>

        <h2>Width and Height</h2>
        <p>The next thing on the list is altering the image by its size. Now, this is an easy thing to do because there are only two attributes that change an image's size. <br> <br>
            
        These are <em>width</em> and <em>height</em>. Width and height are interchangable regardless whether you use HTML or CSS. But for now, let's look how width and height can change images. <br> <br>

        For example, a small image: <br>
        <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2024/01/15/13/02/cupcake-8510165_640.png" alt="A chocolate and caramel cake" width="250" height="200"> <br> <br>

        Or a large image: <br>
        <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2024/07/02/12/07/ai-generated-8867608_640.png" alt="A scoop of strawberry-icecream" width="350" height="400"> <br> <br> 

        <h2>Image Links</h2>
        Lastly but not least, images can be used to link other sources such as videos, articles and blogs. To do this you can simply place the image inside of an achor (a) element. <br> <br>
        
        For example, here is an image of an apple that links to the Wikipedia page about the fruit when the user clicks on it. 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">
         <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/18/13/47/apple-1834639_640.jpg" alt="An image about an apple" height="300" width="300"></a>
        </p>

        <p>Overall, I hope ypu enjoyed the basic tutorial for images.</p>
