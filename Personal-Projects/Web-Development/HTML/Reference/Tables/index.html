        <h1>All about Tables</h1>
        <p>
            Today we will learn about tables. Now, tables are very useful for recording and displaying information just like lists except they are contained into boxes. <br> <br> 
            
            Regular tables have rows and columns with the first cells always serving as headers. In HTML, tables have the table element, table headers, table rows and cells. Now there are more elements involved with tables but for now just focus on the four above. 
        </p> <br> 

        <h2>Table Cells</h2>
        <p>
            Now, the first example below is a regular table focusing on the cells which is the (td) element. TD stands for table data as you can see here: <br>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Adrianna</td>
                    <td>Kalecia</td>
                    <td>Aurora</td>
                </tr>
            </table> <br>

            As you can see there is no headers which just places the data in a row. So the user has no idea what this information can be about. 
        </p> <br> 

        <h2>Table Rows</h2>
        <p>
            Now for our second example, it will have rows which is much more helpful: <br> 

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Adrianna</td>
                    <td>Kalecia</td>
                    <td>Aurora</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>100</td>
                    <td>85</td>
                    <td>90</td>
                </tr>
            </table> <br>

            See this table is much easier but it is still missing the headers which provide crucial information 
        </p> <br> 

        <h2>Table Headers</h2>
        <p>
            Finally, we can use headers to pinpoint information in our table. As shown below <br> 

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>First Place</th>
                    <th>Second Place</th>
                    <th>Third Place</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Adrianna</td>
                    <td>Aurora</td>
                    <td>Kalecia</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>100</td>
                    <td>90</td>
                    <td>85</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>

        <p>And on that final note, I hope you enjoyed learning about tables as much as I did!</p>
