        <h1>Basic Formatting</h1>
        <em>by Kalecia McNeal</em>

        <p>Welcome to another one of my blog post!</p> 
        
        <p>Today, we will show you how to format text using basic elements. As you notice on the web, there are thousands of ways to format text in various ways. But for beginner's sake, we will do just 6. These six are the most common elements you will see in the code. With that in mind, here we go!</p> 
        
        <br> 

        <p>
            <strong>Br:</strong> Now if you were look into the code using Inspect on Chrome, you can spot our first element which is (br). This element is designed to provide space by breaking up lines also known as line break where its name comes from. <br> <br>

            <strong>Strong: or B:</strong> Our next element is strong. This elements allows to bold text <strong>like this</strong>. Another fellow element you can use is b. This element also allows you to bold text <b>like this</b>. But there are specific cases where one will be preferable over the other. <br> <br>

            <strong>Em: or I:</strong> Just like our last entries, these two elements (em) emphasis and (i) italicized slant text to make a point. <em>Like this</em> or <i>This</i>. Either way it is nice to have more than one way to do the same thing. <br> <br> 

            <strong>U:</strong> Lastly but not least, we have (u) or underline. This element allows you to underline text. <u>Like so.</u> This is designed to help point out things in text.

            <br><br>

            And that is a wrap! Otherwise than that, I hope this helps!
