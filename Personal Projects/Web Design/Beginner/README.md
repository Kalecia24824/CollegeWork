# The Beginner Project folder 
<em>By Kalecia McNeal</em>

Welcome to the Beginner subfolder in the Web Design main directory of the Personal Projects folder! Here you can find all of my early projects where I am learning the basics of web design. In this folder, you will find simple websites, layout and single pages as I become familiar with design tools and understand the basics of how web pages are created. These projects are designed to help me build a solid foundation and experiment with different design concepts. 

## What you can expect from this page: 
- Basic page designs 
- Simple Layouts 
- 1st attempts at creating user-friendly pages 
- A focus om learning fundamentals
