# The Intermediate Project Folder 
<em>By Kalecia McNeal</em>

Welcome to the Intermediate subfolder in the Web Design main directory of the Personal Projects folder! Here you can find all of my designs as my knowledge in web design grew. As I became more confident, I decided to work on more complex designs with a focus on user experience and visual appeal. The major difference you will notice is better navigation, design consistency and more interactive web pages. 

## What you can expect from this page: 
- More Detailed and Polished Designs
- Improved site navigation and usability 
- Experimenting with color and layout schemes 
- Designs with a clearer purpose and focus
